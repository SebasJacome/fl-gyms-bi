TODO

    * Change the file transformation to something like this:
	  JSONs -> SQLite -> Parquets

		  With SQLite, I'll perform the fundamental reduction of the databases, leaving only the data that corresponds to what we are interested in: Gyms in Florida.

		  Once we have the cleansed database, we can store this information as parquet to reduce the number of partitions.

		  With the parquet files, we can start with the visualizations

	* Visualizations are still pending

	* Streamlit dashboard pending as well
